# Machine Learning Algorithms on Titanic Survival
## Overview
This academic project covers various machine learning models such as Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to analyze the dataset and make predictions based on the processed data. It involves data preprocessing for handling missing values, transformation, model selection, training, correlation heatmap, confusion matrix, evaluation, and performance comparison.
## Implementation
The project is implemented using Apache Spark and machine learning libraries, including:
PySpark for distributed data processing
MLlib for machine learning models
pandas and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
## Results & Discussion
The Decision Tree performs better in terms of overall accuracy and scores than the Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression.
